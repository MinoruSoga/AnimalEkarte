# Extensions Directory

Place your local Gemini CLI extensions here.
Each extension should be in its own subdirectory and contain a `gemini-extension.json` file.

Example structure:
```
.gemini/extensions/
└── my-extension/
    ├── gemini-extension.json
    └── commands/
        └── my-command.toml
```
